## Angular 4 Data Table

A simple Angular 4 data table module with built-in solutions for features including:

* pagination
* sorting
* row selection (single/multi)
* expandable rows
* column resizing
* selecting visible columns

The component can be used with local data as well as remote data resources: for example if the sorting and paging happen in the database.

The templates use bootstrap CSS class names, so the component requires a bootstrap .css file to be present in the application using it.

## Installing:
`npm install angular-4-data-table --save`
